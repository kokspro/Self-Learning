# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a JavaScript learning repository containing hands-on practice exercises and notes. The project is a self-learning workspace focused on mastering fundamental JavaScript concepts through practical coding exercises.

## Project Structure

## Learning Progress

Based on git commit history, the learning journey covers:
- JavaScript fundamentals (operators, control flow, objects)
- Arrays and array methods (filtering, mapping, reducing)
- Functions (declarations, expressions, arrow functions)
- Object-oriented concepts (factory functions, constructors)

## Working with the Code

### Running JavaScript Code
- Open `index.html` in a web browser to execute `app.js`
- Use browser developer tools console to see output
- Uncomment code blocks in `app.js` or `exercises.js` to test different concepts

### Code Organization
- `javaScript.txt`: Contains comprehensive learning notes with syntax examples
- `app.js`: Working examples with most code commented out for selective testing  
- `exercises.js`: Completed exercise solutions organized by topic (functions, objects, arrays)

### Development Notes
- Uses standard JavaScript ES6+ features
- Code follows a learning progression from basics to advanced concepts
- Examples include both verbose and concise implementations for comparison
- Heavy use of console.log() for learning and debugging

## Key Learning Areas Covered

1. **Fundamentals**: Variables, operators, control flow
2. **Objects**: Factory functions, constructors, cloning techniques  
3. **Arrays**: Methods like map(), filter(), reduce(), find()
4. **Functions**: Different declaration styles, parameters, rest/spread operators
5. **Practical Exercises**: FizzBuzz, grade calculators, prime numbers, and more

## Development Workflow

The typical workflow involves:
1. Reading concepts in `javaScript.txt`
2. Practicing with examples in `app.js` 
3. Solving exercises in `exercises.js`
4. Committing progress with descriptive messages

No build tools, package managers, or testing frameworks are currently used - this is a pure JavaScript learning environment focused on browser-based execution.
