BASICS:
    OBJECTS:
        REFERENCE TYPES:
            OBJECT:
                let person = {
                    name: 'Mosh',
                    age: 40
                };
                person.name;
                person['name'];
            ARRAY:
                let selected = [];
            FUNCTION:
                function nameIt() {}

OPERATORS:
    //Leaving out universal/common knowledge
    ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:
    ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS:
    COMPARISON OPERATORS:
    EQUALITY OPERATORS:
        === (Equals) (Strict Equality Same Type + Value)
        !== (Does not Equal)
        ==  (Equals) (Loose Equality converts the right side type to match left side type, checks values after)
        != (Does not Equal)
    TERNARY OPERATORS:
        conditional ? 'true option' : 'false option';
    LOGICAL OPERATORS:
    LOGICAL OPERATORS WITH NON-BOOLEANS:
        Falsy (false):
            undefined
            null
            0
            false
            ''
            NaN
        Truthy (true):
            Anything NOT Falsy
    BITWISE OPERATORS:
            Technical and super niche, not taking notes.   
            Can always go back and refresh if I need.
            It is just logical using bits, easy peasy actually.

CONTROL FLOW:
    IF ELSE:
    SWITCH CASE:
        switch (role) {
            case 'value':
                statement;
                break;
            default:
                statement;
        }
    FOR:
        for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {}
    WHILE:
    DO WHILE:
    FOR IN: - Better for properties of an object
        for (let var in otherThing) {}
    FOR OF: - Better for elements in an array
        for (let var of array?) {}
    BREAK AND CONTINUE:
        break; to exit a loop
        continue; to jump to top of loop
